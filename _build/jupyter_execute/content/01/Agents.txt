# Agents
* Robot: simulated
* Sensor: noisy state
* Think: plan, Markov localization, RL
* Act: Discrete
* Topics needed: RL graphs & KF
* Factor graph concepts: planning, markov localization


## Discrete States and Actions

## Classical Planning

## MDP
A Markov decision process (MDP) has states $x$ and actions $a$...
