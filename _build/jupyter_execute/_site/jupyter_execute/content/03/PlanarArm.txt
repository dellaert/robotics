# Planar Arms
* Robot: Planar arms
* Sensor: joint encoders
* Think: motion planning
* Act: control joint angles 
* Topics needed: manipulator kinematics, control, motion planning, optimal control and trajectory optimization, RRT
* Factor graph concepts: smoothing w GTSAM, between factors, goal factor, obstacle factors (after RRT) $n_s$ is the sample, $n_{new}$ is the new node, etc.
